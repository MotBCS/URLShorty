# URL SHORTY

URL Shorty is a service that lets the user submit a long URL which is then shortened to make it easier to use.

URL Shorty keeps a record of the short URL and maps it to the longer URL. When a user requests the shortened URL, URLShorty returns a HTTP redirect code, sending the user to the long URL.
